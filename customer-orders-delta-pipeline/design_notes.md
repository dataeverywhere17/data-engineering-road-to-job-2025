1. Data Ingestion (Raw Layer)
The pipeline begins with raw files (CSV, JSON, XML, etc.) received through:

Manual upload

SFTP

API integrations

Event-based triggers (e.g., Logic App, Event Grid)

These files are landed in Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2, under a raw/ folder.

🟠 2. Bronze Layer – Landing Raw Data
In Databricks, we read the raw data using PySpark:

python
Copy
Edit
df = spark.read.option("header", True).csv("abfss://container@storageaccount.dfs.core.windows.net/raw/")
Then we store it as-is in Delta format for reliability and queryability:

python
Copy
Edit
df.write.format("delta").mode("overwrite").save("/mnt/bronze/customer_orders")
✅ The Bronze layer holds raw but structured data, making it ready for further processing.

🟡 3. Silver Layer – Clean and Transform
We read the Bronze data:

python
Copy
Edit
df = spark.read.format("delta").load("/mnt/bronze/customer_orders")
Then apply transformations like:

Removing bad/null rows

Casting data types (cast("amount" as Double))

Parsing dates (to_date())

Standardizing column names or formats

Finally, save it back in Delta format:

python
Copy
Edit
df_cleaned.write.format("delta").mode("overwrite").save("/mnt/silver/customer_orders")
✅ The Silver layer contains cleaned, validated data, often joined with lookup tables like products or customer info.

🟢 4. Gold Layer – Business-Ready Data
We aggregate or reshape the silver data based on business needs:

Daily sales totals

Revenue by region/product

Orders per customer

We follow a star schema here with:

Fact tables (e.g., fact_orders)

Dimension tables (e.g., dim_product, dim_customer)

✅ This is what Power BI connects to for visualization.

⚙️ 5. Orchestration via Azure Data Factory (ADF)
A pipeline is created to:

Monitor file arrival (optional)

Trigger Databricks notebooks in sequence

Use Copy Activity if needed (e.g., FTP → ADLS)

Set a daily trigger or run on-demand

✅ This makes the pipeline automated and repeatable.

📊 6. Visualization in Power BI
The Gold layer is exposed as a SQL endpoint (via Databricks or Synapse)

Power BI dashboards consume this layer and support slicing/dicing by:

Date, Region, Product, Customer, etc.

✅ Summary:
This architecture gives us:

Flexible storage (Data Lake)

Scalable processing (Databricks + Delta)

Reliable automation (ADF)

Business insights (Power BI)
