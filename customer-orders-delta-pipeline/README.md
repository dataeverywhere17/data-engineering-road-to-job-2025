## Objective
Simulate a real-world data engineering pipeline using Azure and Databricks.

### Goals:
- Ingest raw customer orders data from ADLS (CSV)
- Process data using PySpark (cleansing, transformations, joins)
- Store data in Delta format using medallion architecture (bronze, silver, gold)
- Visualize the final data in Power BI
- Automate with ADF and monitor pipeline status

## Tech Stack
- Azure Data Lake Gen2
- Databricks (PySpark)
- Azure Data Factory
- Delta Lake
- Power BI
